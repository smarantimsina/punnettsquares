        <p>Punnett Squares have been used for years to calculate the passing of genes from parent to offspring in sexual reproduction. Given the traits of the parents you are able to see what traits will be passed down using just a simple square divided in four parts as shown below</p>

            <p class="psqex">Given the image used above and to put something in context of the image say a hamster that is heterozygous (different allele pair (one upper and one lower case)) for having black hair breeds with homozygous (allele pair is same whether capital or lower) recessive for orange hair. This shows the combination that the offspring will get, and the thing about dominant traits is that they take over whether there are two of them or if there is another recessive trait. Showing half of them (50%) will have the combination of Hh which would be black hair and the other half (50%) will have the combination to orange hair.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="psqex">The calculation of the percentage of the combination is different from calculating the trait probability itself. The combination makeup is called the genotype, the physical feature makeup is called phenotype. These probabilities can differ because if the combination was a two heterozygous black hair hamsters then the probability of genotypes would be 50% Hh, 25% HH, 25% hh, HOWEVER the phenotype calculation would be 75% black hair and 25% orange hair.</p>
